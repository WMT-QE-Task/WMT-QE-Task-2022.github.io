title: 'Task 2: Explainable QE'
---



The main goal of the explainability for QE subtask is to explore the potential of building a quality estimation system that predicts the quality score for an input pair of source text and target MT and is able to provide word-level evidence as explanation for its predictions.

For the explainable QE subtask we will use the same language pairs used in [Task 1](../subtasks/task1.md):

 - English-Russian (En-Ru)
 - English-German (En-De)
 - Chinese-English (Zh-En)
 - English-Marathi (En-Ma)
 - English-Czech (En-Cs)
 - English-Japanese (En-Ja)
 - Khmer-English (Km-En)
 - Pashto-English (Ps-En)

For each language pair the participants can use the sentence-level score to train their QE systems. The sentence level scores will be normalised to minimise differences between the MQM and DA scales. The participants will be to provide word-level errors as explanations for each predicted sentence score.
 

> #### **Upcoming**
> Apart from the language-pairs mentioned above, we will also provide test sets on some **surprise** language-pairs.  Check-back soon!
