# Word-level Subtask

The word-level subtask evaluates the application of QE for post-editing purposes. It consists of predicting word-level tags for the target side (to detect mistranslated or missing words). Each token is tagged as either OK or BAD. 

The OK/BAD tags are provided for each of the language of the sentence level task, and are derived from MQM annotations and post-edited sentences respectively.
