title: 'Task 1: Quality prediction'
---

The quality prediction task follows the trend of the previous years in comprising a **sentence-level subtask** where the goal is to predict the quality score for each source-target sentence pair and a **word-level subtask** where the goal is to predict the translation errors, assigning OK/BAD tags to each word of the target. 

Both subtasks include annotations derived in two different ways, depending on the language pair: direct assessments (DA), following the trend of older editions, and multi-dimensional quality metrics (MQM), aligned with the [Metrics shared task](https://wmt-metrics-task.github.io/). Detailed information for the language pairs, the annotation specifics, and the available training and development resources in each category are provided below. We also note that the sentence- and word-level subtasks use the same source-target sentences for each language pair.


> #### **Important**
> Participants will be able to submit predictions for **any** of the subtasks/language pairs of their choice (or all of them).
